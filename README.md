Problem Statement:

The increasing number of road accidents caused by drowsy driving poses a significant threat to public safety. To address this issue, there is a critical need for an advanced and reliable System for the safety of drivers.

Solution:
Description of IoT-based Drowsiness Detection System for Vehicle Safety:

The IoT-based Drowsiness Detection System is a cutting-edge technology designed to enhance road safety by continuously monitoring the driver's state and ensuring they are alert and sober while driving. This system combines various sensors and intelligent algorithms to detect drowsiness and alcohol consumption in the driver, employing multiple layers of security and vigilance.

Alcohol Sensor:
The system incorporates a highly sensitive alcohol sensor, such as a semiconductor-based gas sensor, to detect alcohol vapors in the vicinity of the driver's breath. Before starting the vehicle, the driver is required to blow into a designated area near the steering wheel to measure the alcohol content. If the alcohol concentration exceeds a predefined threshold, the vehicle will not start, ensuring that only sober individuals can operate it.

Fingerprint Scanner:
To prevent unauthorized access and ensure the right person is behind the wheel, the system utilizes a fingerprint scanner integrated into the vehicle's start button or ignition system. The driver needs to place their finger on the scanner, and only if a match is found with pre-registered fingerprints, the engine will start.

IR Sensor for Drowsiness Detection:
An infrared (IR) sensor is strategically placed on the steering wheel to monitor the driver's position and movements. The sensor continuously tracks the driver's face and head orientation. If it detects that the driver is leaning forward excessively or displaying erratic steering behavior, it raises an alert as a potential sign of drowsiness or distraction.

OpenCV-based Drowsiness Detection:
The IoT-based Drowsiness Detection System incorporates computer vision capabilities using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). A camera positioned near the driver's seat analyzes the driver's facial features and eye movements to determine their level of drowsiness. The system classifies the driver's state into three categories: awake, sleepy, and sleeping.

Awake: The system detects the driver as fully alert, with normal eye blinking and facial expressions.
Sleepy: When the system identifies signs of drowsiness, such as heavy eyelids or longer blink durations, it categorizes the driver as sleepy.
Sleeping: If the driver's eyes are closed for an extended period or exhibit patterns consistent with falling asleep, the system categorizes the driver as sleeping and triggers immediate warnings.
Warnings and Alerts:
When the system detects signs of drowsiness or alcohol intoxication, it issues real-time alerts to the driver through a combination of audio, visual, and haptic feedback. Alerts may include audible warnings, vibrating steering wheel, visual prompts on the dashboard, or even seat vibrations.

Additionally, the system can be integrated with the vehicle's safety features, such as automatic braking or lane departure warning, to take corrective actions when a drowsy or intoxicated state is detected.

The IoT-based Drowsiness Detection System aims to reduce the number of accidents caused by drowsy or impaired drivers, making roads safer for all users. It emphasizes the importance of driver alertness and responsible behavior, promoting safe driving practices.
